1) Delete entries but limit the deletion in case the same entry is present multiple times.  

    PSQL --> DELETE FROM table WHERE ctid IN (SELECT ctid FROM table WHERE conditions LIMIT 1);                                               
  in this case above, the deletion will be limited to one.
  ctid - represents the physical location of a tuple (row) within its tableÃ¬s data file.                                            
2) Create a foreign key while creating a table
   PSQL --> CREATE TABLE table_name(column_1 SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, column_2 INT, FOREIGN KEY(column_2) REFERENCES     another_table(another_column))
